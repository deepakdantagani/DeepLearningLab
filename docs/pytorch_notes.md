# PyTorch Notes

## 1. What is `Tensor`?
- `Tensor` is a data structure from the PyTorch library used for multi-dimensional arrays and numerical computations.
- In code: `from torch import Tensor`
- Used for type annotations in function signatures, e.g., `def foo(x: Tensor) -> Tensor:`
- Represents the primary way to store and manipulate data in PyTorch.
